          <p allign="justify">
            Technology has many advantages in our life. Technology converts the
            available useful raw materail to useful products. Technology can
            helps us save a lot of time by making complex task into simple one.
            some major positive impacts are:<br /><br />

            i)information access: The technology helps us to improve the access
            of information for example we can see the iformation of almost all
            the countries in the world from our place.<br /><br />

            ii)Good communication: Because of technology like mobile phones the
            communicatin is made more accessible like we can talk, see and
            excahnge information between the people thats are very far away from
            us.<br /><br />

            iii) Easy transportation: Previously it used to take a lot of time
            to reach very far palces beacuse of the transportation technology
            like car, airplanes and helicoptor we can travel to very far places
            in a very short amount of time.<br /><br />

            iv) Education: Technology has positve impacts on education as well
            taking our college as example practicals are done through computers,
            teaching is done through projector and presentation is also done.<br /><br />

            v) Hospitals: The technology has helps us to improve the quality of
            hospital facilities. From the machines like x-ray, mri it makes us
            easier to imrpove the health of the coonsumer.<br /><br />

          <h2><b>Negative Impacts</b></h2>
          <P allign="justify">
            Though there are various advantages of technology in our life, there
            are many disadvantages of technology as well. some of the major
            negative impacts of technology are as follows:<br /><br />

            i) boredom or lonliness: since most of people spend their time in
            social networking sites there is increased lonliness. many people
            neglect their real life. for example many people sitting in
            restaurant are busy in their mobiles phones insteaed of talking with
            their family members.<br /><br />

            ii)less creativity and more dependency: since majority of the task
            of the modern world is done by machines, people are dependend on
            technology more than they should be due to which the creativity of
            the people has decreased vastly. Because of the technology people
            are vastly dependend on trasportation.<br /><br />

            iii)Hazardous weapons: beacuse of the advancement of modern
            technology many weapons that could destroy the world are created.
            many selfish people can use those weapon can use those for
            destruction and we cannot do anything to stop if they are used.<br /><br />

            iv)unemployement: previously most of the works were done by the
            people themselves because of which the products were quality
            products but in the modern world the people are replaced by the
            machines and all the work is done by the machines due to which
            unemployment problem has increased vastly.<br /><br />

            v) Laziness and health issues: Because of the mordern technology the
            people are becoming more and more lazy. they dont walk and always
            use transportation machines to go to another place. stuents can get
            easy access to information due to which they dont study properly. as
            people are becoming more lazy health issues like cholestol and heart
            disease also increase.<br />
          </P>
